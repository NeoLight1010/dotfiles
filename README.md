# NeoLight1010's Dotfiles

Hi! Welcome to my dotfiles. These are the configuration files of some of the
apps/tools I often use. The repo is organized in multiple directories depending
on the tool. For example, in the `nvim` directory, are the configuration files
for NeoVim, like the `init.vim` file, or `coc-setting.json`.

Feel free to use these files if you want.
